# --- MicroPython Tools (install on your computer) ---
# Used for flashing firmware and interacting with ESP32
esptool>=4.7.0        # Flash ESP32 firmware
mpremote>=1.22.0      # Upload and run files on ESP32
rshell>=0.0.31        # Alternative REPL/file transfer tool (optional)
adafruit-ampy>=1.1.0  # Legacy file transfer tool (optional)

# --- Web Application Dependencies (required for Flask app) ---
Flask>=3.0.0          # Web framework for the dashboard
flask-cors>=4.0.0     # CORS support for API endpoints
requests>=2.31.0      # HTTP library for ThingSpeak API calls

# --- Host-side Python Libraries (optional) ---
# These are not required on the ESP32 itself, but useful for local testing/simulation
pytest>=7.4.0         # For running unit tests locally
pylint>=2.17.0        # Code linting
black>=23.9.1         # Code formatting

# --- Notes ---
# 1. 'machine', 'network', 'urequests' are built into MicroPython firmware (ESP32) and not installable via pip.
# 2. Copy 'urequests.py' manually to the ESP32 /lib folder if your firmware build does not include it.
# 3. Define THINGSPEAK_WRITE_KEY in a separate secrets.py file (not tracked in Git).
